                        <p>This page is my first serious web thing.
                            <br />This is not my first project, though: take a look at
                            <a href="#projects" class="link">my projects</a> or my
                            <a href="https://github.com/grantfanian" class="link">GitHub profile</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>Everything on this page is done using CSS, except one JS line:
                            <code>if (<span class="syntax syntax-set">document.loaction.hash == </span><span class="syntax syntax-string">&quot;&quot;</span>) { <span class="syntax syntax-set">document.location.hash = </span><span class="syntax syntax-string">&quot;#home&quot;</span> }</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This line switches to home page if current is unset.<br />
                            <br />All the code is written by myself from docs, without copypasting :), and tested on
                            different platforms and screens.
                            <br /> This focus on the website's code made it have so little content.
                            <br /> I can do something with WebGL or backend for the next time.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The page also works on mobile.<br />
                            Source code with commit history is
                            <a class="link" href="https://github.com/grantfanian/grantfanian.github.io"> on GitHub</a>.
                            <br>
                            This page is somewhat inspired by <a href="https://fosny.eu/" class="link">fosny.eu</a>.
                            <br />The design is simple and functional.

                        <p>Most of my projects will remain unknown.
                            Most I have abandoned just because of losing the mood,
                            <br />but the experience gain from them is very high.
                            <br />and about some other projects... I either lost them, because I liked to switch OSes,
                            PCs and Linux
                            distros <i>"the hard
                                way"</i>,
                            <br /> or don't want to disclose them, because I think they're miserable or may be illegal.
                            <br /> The ones I've published still deserve some attention though.

                        <p>My name is Grant Fanian.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in engineering. I like tinkering with computers, programming, electronics.
                            <br />Many other things I found interesting, unfortunately, aren't available to me. <br />
                            Eventually, I want to try out everything about engineering, from idea to a
                            consumer&sol;application-ready product.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>I don't play games, mostly just watch youtube about coding and stuff, or actually do
                            something.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>My native language is russian and I think I have an OK level of english.
                            <br />In Czech republic, though, these languages are not too versatile :).
                            <br />
                            I think I'm getting better at czech, but not enough to make up this content so quick :).

                    <section style="text-align:justify;width:40vw;">
                        <p>All the pages you can switch between are the same HTML
                            document, and switched with only CSS. One of the drawbacks it produces is that it's less
                            compatiable with old browsers. <br>Some of them, for example, IE, may not even support
                            <span style="color:aqua">calc()</span>. I,&nbsp;personally, don't care much about
                            compatibility
                            with IE, because it is so bad at everything we should consider it a text-mode browser. In a
                            text-mode browser, it works nicely: all the pages just show up, no animation and everything
                            is usable. Nice!&nbsp;:)
                        </p>
                        <p>The "pages" (views) of this page are scrollable, but contain not enough content to
                            demonstrate it.
                            I&nbsp;will put some placeholding elements at the end to show it out.
                        </p>
                        <p>The SVG elements for the left page are hand-optimized: original's precision is reduced so
                            much, that it barely looks alright. That makes each of SVG's look better than a PNG, but
                            weigh even less than a minimal 32x32 png.</p>
